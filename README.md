# Generate test data with the Stripe CLI

Testing Stripe integrations can be tricky, especially for complex flows like subscriptions or Connect platforms.

We wrote some test fixtures to help you quickly generate test data with the Stripe CLI. Use these or write your own test fixtures following the same spec.

Learn more about the CLI's [fixture command](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/wiki/fixtures-command) in the CLI documentation.

## How to use

#### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/stripe-samples/test-data
```

#### 2. [Install the CLI](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli#installation)

Be sure to log in with your Stripe credentials so the CLI can use your test mode API keys.

#### 3. Run the fixture command with the test data you want to seed

The CLI will create all the Stripe objects defined in the fixture file in test mode.

```
stripe fixtures two-sku-store/create-fixtures.json
```

#### 4. You should now see the test data in your Dashboard! âœ¨

![An image of the newly create SKU in the Dashboard](/preview.png "An image of the newly create SKU in the Dashboard")

#### 5. [optional] Delete the test data

Each fixture has a `delete-fixtures.json` that cleans up the relevant test data.

## Contribute

We'd love contributions! Feel free to share a test fixture you found useful when building your Stripe integration.

Open a PR against this repo and add:

1. A new directory for your test fixtures (e.g. `two-sku-store`).
2. A `create-fixtures.json` file that creates the test data.
3. A `delete-fixtures.json` that tears down the test data.
4. [optional] A little about the business you're building and why this test fixture helped you model it ðŸ˜Š (only if you want some free advertising!)
